Lab 10 - Exam Preparation Exercises

(100 marks in total, including:
8 code tracing exercises (5 marks each, 40 marks in total);
3 coding quetions (20 marks each, 60 marks in total))

Your Name: Harvinder Kaur
Due date: Apr. 5, 2024, 11am

Objective:
1. Review the function 
2. Review the conditionals (if-else)
3. Review the program flow (for/while - continue, break)
4. Practice when to use and how to operate on the collection data types: 
tuple, list, string, set, dictionary.
6. Review the accumulator algorithm pattern (Initialize-Loop-Return):
   Initialize a variable (accumulator) that is assigned to an integer, a list, etc. 
   Loop (for or while) to update the variable based on requirements; 
   Return the variable.

Exercise 4, 5, 6 - Code tracing (15 marks in total)

First read and understand the following function.
Then answer the questions below:

Question 1: What will it print if we call this function by running 
print(practice_for_index_1([5, 5, 2, 9, 9, 6], 9))? (5 marks)
Your answer is: 3


Question 2: Are the function practice_for_index_1(nums, target) and 
the function practice_for_index_2(nums, target) have the same 
functionality? Why? (5 marks)

Your answer is: No 
(Because in practice_for_index_1, as target element found, it returns index and exits loop 
and return -1when target does not found. Whereas, practice_for_index_2 keeps updating
index variable when target is found. even if there are multiple occurrences of the 
target element, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If the target 
element is not found, it returns -1.


Question 3: Are the function 
practice_for_index_2(nums, target) and the function 
practice_for_index_3(nums, target) have the same 
functionality? Why? (5 marks)

Your answer is: No 
(Because in practice_for_index_2, once the target element is found, 
it breaks out of the loop immediately after updating the index variablewith the found index. So, it 
returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element.In practice_for_index_3, it also iterates through the list to find the target element,
but it doesn't break out of the loop immediately after finding the first occurrence. 
It continues iterating until the end of the list and updates the index variable with 
the last occurrence of the target element, if any).

Exercise 9 - Coding question

Write a function named "exist_in_both" that takes two strings as input 
and returns the number of characters that occur in both strings.
You can assume that all characters within a string are unique (no repeats).

For example, 
if the function is passed "lap" and "help", 
the function exist_in_both("lap","help") will return 2,
because the characters "l" and "p" occur in both strings.

For example,
exist_in_both("computer","mute") wil return 4.

Pass your own unit tests. (5 marks)

Exercise 10 - Coding question

If both adjacent letters in a word are the same, 
we call the two adjacent letters are "good neighbors".

E.g.1, there are one pair of good neighbors inside the word "apple",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'p'.

E.g.2, there are two pairs of good neighbors inside the word "occurrence",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'c'; 
word[4] == word[5], and they are both 'r'.

E.g.3, there are two pairs of good neighbors inside the word "hmmm",
since word[1] == word[2], and they are both 'm'; 
word[2] == word[3], and they are both 'm'.


Write a function called "good_neighbors" that accepts a word as input, 
and return the number of pairs of good_neighbors. 
Assume that all the letters in the word are lowercase letters, 
and there are at least two letters in the word.

For example, good_neighbors("happy") will return 1, 
since there is one pair of adjacent letters 'p'.

good_neighbors("occurrence") will return 2, 
since there are twp pairs of adjacent letters, 'c' and 'r'.

word_example = "arrrrhhh"
good_neighbors(word_example) will return 5, since
word_example[1] == word_example[2], both 'r'
word_example[2] == word_example[3], both 'r'
word_example[3] == word_example[4], both 'r'
word_example[5] == word_example[6], both 'h'
word_example[6] == word_example[7], both 'h'


Hint:

We may compare each letter word[i] with its neighbor word[i + 1], 
while traversing the word using index i. Use the accumulator algorithm pattern.

Exercise 11 - Coding question

Implement a function called "more_than_2" that accepts a list of strings as input. 
The function identifies strings that occur more than two times in the list,
and return these strings as a list. 

Eg.1, fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "apple", "pear", "orange",
"banana", "banana", "watermelon"] 
more_than_2(fruits) will return ["apple","banana"]. 

Eg.2, colors = ["red", "red", "yellow", "green", "red", "yellow", "orange",
"green", "banana", "yellow"] 
more_than_2(colors) will return ["red", "yellow"]. 

Hint: Utilize dict data type to count the occurrences for each string, 
then traverse all the keys in the dict and compares its value to 3. 
Use the accumulator algorithm pattern.
